Neat little simulator (up to 2 qubits for now) showing the behavior of my own interpretation of a qubit.
To run, clone repository in local environment and use npm start.

Feel free to copy my code and add to the model for yourself.

Things to be fixed:
If both qubits are in superposition, it will not let you cnot them.
If both qubits are entangled and both in superposition, it will not let you Hadamard either of them
